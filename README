The intention of this project is to create a timeline diagram with
information about the main RDBMS since the 70' up until now.

The information this diagram is based on has been obtained via
multiple websites and several books. A list with all references will
be available in the file BIBLIOGRAPHY.

This is a work in progress. There is still a lot of information
missing. If you have any information which can make this diagram
better, please do not hesitate to contact me or send a patch via
GITHUB.


INSTALL
-------

We use Graphviz [1] to generate the SVG and PNG versions og the
diagram.

You need to install Graphviz in your system if you want to use the
RDBMS_timeline.dot file to generate other formats.

With Graphviz installed you can run these commands to generate the
diagram:

* PNG: dot -Tpng -o RDBMS_timeline.png RDBMS_timeline.dot
* SVG: dot -Tsvg -o RDBMS_timeline.svg RDBMS_timeline.dot
